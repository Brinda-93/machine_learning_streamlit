# Machine Learning Web App

## Overview
This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that allows users to train and evaluate multiple **machine learning classifiers** on a **mushroom dataset**. The classifiers available include:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Features
- Users can upload and process a dataset.
- Provides various machine learning classifiers.
- Allows users to tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Visualizes results with metrics like:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **ROC Curve**
  - **Precision-Recall Curve**

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). Install dependencies using:
